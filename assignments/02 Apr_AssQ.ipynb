The user specifies a range of values for each hyperparameter that they want to test, and Grid Search CV creates a grid of all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

This can be a disadvantage if the hyperparameter space is large or if the optimal hyperparameters are located in an area of low density. This is because Grid Search CV can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for high-dimensional datasets.\n",

    "Grid Search CV is useful when the hyperparameters are known to have a large impact on the model's performance, and the hyperparameter space is relatively small. Grid Search CV is also useful when a small number of hyperparameters are to be tuned. This method is also preferred when you have enough time and computational resources to perform an exhaustive search.\n",

Additionally, Randomized Search CV can sometimes find better hyperparameters than Grid Search CV in the same amount of time, especially if the optimal hyperparameters are located in a less dense region of the hyperparameter space."

Make sure that none of the data in the validation or testing datasets is used for training the model.\n",
