    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting websites and web applications. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Infrastructure: Traditional web hosting typically involves hosting websites on a single server or a group of servers located in a data center. In contrast, cloud hosting involves hosting websites and web applications on a distributed network of servers that are interconnected and managed by a cloud service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: Traditional web hosting usually offers limited scalability. As the traffic to the website grows, the server may become overloaded, leading to slow performance or even downtime. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, offers high scalability. It allows you to scale up or down the resources of your website or web application, depending on the traffic demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cost: Traditional web hosting typically requires you to pay a fixed fee for a set of resources, such as disk space, bandwidth, and CPU usage. In contrast, cloud hosting offers a pay-as-you-go model, where you only pay for the resources you use. This can be more cost-effective in situations where the traffic to your website or web application fluctuates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Security: Both traditional web hosting and cloud hosting offer security features such as firewalls, SSL certificates, and backups. However, cloud hosting offers additional security benefits due to its distributed architecture. In case one server fails, the other servers in the network can take over, ensuring the continuity of service and preventing data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Management: Traditional web hosting requires you to manage the server yourself or rely on the support of the hosting provider. In contrast, cloud hosting offers more automation and management tools, allowing you to manage your website or web application more easily and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while traditional web hosting can be a good option for simple websites with low traffic, cloud hosting offers higher scalability, cost-effectiveness, security, and management capabilities for more complex websites and web applications."

    "Choosing the right cloud provider for your application deployment is crucial to ensure that your application runs smoothly, securely, and cost-effectively. Here are some factors you should consider when selecting a cloud provider:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pricing`: Pricing is an important factor to consider when selecting a cloud provider. You should compare the pricing of different providers based on the services you need, such as compute, storage, networking, and data transfer. Additionally, you should consider whether the provider offers pay-as-you-go pricing, which can be more cost-effective for applications with variable traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scalability`: The ability to scale your application up or down depending on the traffic demand is another critical factor to consider. You should ensure that the cloud provider offers scalable compute and storage resources, as well as load balancing and auto-scaling features.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reliability`: The reliability of the cloud provider is essential to ensure that your application is available to users at all times. You should consider the provider's uptime guarantee, disaster recovery capabilities, and the availability of multiple data centers in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Security`: Security is a critical factor to consider when selecting a cloud provider. You should ensure that the provider offers robust security features such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and data encryption, as well as compliance with industry regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Support`: The level of support provided by the cloud provider can impact your application's performance and availability. You should consider the provider's support channels, response times, and the availability of technical experts to assist you in case of issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Technology stack`: The technology stack supported by the cloud provider is also an essential factor to consider. You should ensure that the provider supports the programming languages, databases, and other technologies that your application uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "`User community`: The cloud provider's user community can provide valuable insights and support in case of issues. You should consider the size and activity level of the provider's user community, as well as the availability of online resources such as documentation, forums, and tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, selecting the right cloud provider requires careful consideration of the pricing, scalability, reliability, security, support, technology stack, and user community. You should evaluate multiple providers based on these factors and choose the one that best fits your application's requirements and budget."

    "\n",
    "1. Libraries: All the required libraries need to be installed. This was done in the skill lab by listing all the required libraries like pandas , numpy , scikit learn , pickle , etc in the requirements.txt and executing it in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EDA, FEATURE ENGINEERING AND SELECTION: The desired data is analysed using EDA and vetted to find the most important features which can be used for our model building in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prepare the model: The machine learning model should be trained and optimized for deployment.In the case of the Algerian Fires project  the data was scaled using standard scaler and different models were tested and Ridge regression was chosen because it had best outcome after cross validation. The model should also be saved in a format that is compatible with the web application's technology stack and therefore the ridge model and scaler were saved in pickle file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set up the server: A server-side component should be set up to handle requests from the user interface and return predictions from the machine learning model. This server can be implemented using a framework such as Flask. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Define the API: An application programming interface (API) should be defined that allows the user interface to communicate with the server-side component. This API should define the inputs required by the machine learning model, such as data or user inputs, and the output format, such as the prediction or classification result.The flask frame work was used and html files like the index.html and the predictdata.html were created and the same were integrated into the flask api. Also all the necessary files like the model and scaler were loaded (from the pickle file format) into the flask frame work and integrated to work with the GET and POST requests from the predictdata.html. The libraries like Flask , request , jsonify and render_templates were used for the API integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Test and deploy: The integrated system should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is functioning correctly. Once tested, the system can be deployed to a production environment like ASW using ElasticBeanstalk and Pipeline."
