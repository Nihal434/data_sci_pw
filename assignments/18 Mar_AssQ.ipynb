    "The Filter method is typically used as a preprocessing step to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance of machine learning models.

    "Embedded feature selection methods are techniques that perform feature selection during the model training process. These methods aim to find the best subset of features that contribute the most to the model's predictive power. Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Regularization`: Regularization techniques, such as Lasso and Ridge regression, add a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to select a subset of features that are most relevant to the target variable. These methods can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Decision Trees`: Decision trees are commonly used in feature selection because they can automatically identify the most important features for the model. Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees are examples of decision tree-based models that can be used for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Gradient Descent`: Gradient descent optimization algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdaGrad, can be used to select features that are most important for the model. These methods adjust the model's parameters based on the contribution of each feature to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",

As a result, Lasso Regression tends to shrink the coefficients of less important features towards zero, effectively removing them from the model.
