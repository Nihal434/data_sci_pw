If a clustering algorithm were used to cluster the animals based on their features, it is possible that the algorithm would create a cluster that contains bats as well as other animals that are more clearly birds (e.g., eagles, parrots). In this case, the cluster would have high homogeneity because all the animals in the cluster share the common feature of having wings.
