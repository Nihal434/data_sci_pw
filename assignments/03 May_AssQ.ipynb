    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection as it helps to identify the most relevant features or attributes that are most useful in distinguishing normal data from anomalous data. By selecting the most informative features, the complexity of the model can be reduced, which in turn can improve the detection accuracy and reduce the computational time required for training and testing the model. In addition, feature selection can also help to address the curse of dimensionality, which is a common problem in anomaly detection where the presence of many irrelevant or redundant features can lead to overfitting and reduced detection accuracy."

    "1. **True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall or Sensitivity**: It is the proportion of true anomalies that are correctly identified by the algorithm. It is computed as TPR = TP / (TP + FN), where TP is the number of true positives (anomalies correctly identified) and FN is the number of false negatives (anomalies not identified).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: It is the proportion of non-anomalies that are incorrectly identified as anomalies by the algorithm. It is computed as FPR = FP / (TN + FP), where FP is the number of false positives (non-anomalies incorrectly identified) and TN is the number of true negatives (non-anomalies correctly identified).\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **F1-score**: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balance between them. It is computed as F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**: It is a metric that measures the overall performance of the algorithm across different thresholds of anomaly scores. The AUC is computed as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the TPR against the FPR at different thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curve**: It is a graphical representation of the relationship between the false negative rate and the false positive rate for different decision thresholds. The DET curve is used to compare the performance of different algorithms.\n",
